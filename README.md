### ASP.NET-MVC5_EF6-eCommerce

#####eCommerce solution using MVC5
------

started using MusicShop tutorial as a starting point,
but as I learned more and more I started adding new
features and now this solution is completely upgraded
to MVC5, using EF6 and Simple Membership Provider which
the old tutorial never used.

Also I added partial views for dynamic display of elements
through menu depending on which role user has, while keeping
as much logic as possible outside of Views and in Controllers
to strictly keep MVC design paradigms.

I'd like to say through the course of this project my
knowledge multiplied several times, and my raise of interest
was proportional, which I will translate into learning
other MVC frameworks also

>This is not for commercial use for anyone except myself,
but is a great starting point for learning the basics
of how one eCommerce solution works.
